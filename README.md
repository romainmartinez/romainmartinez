I lead AI initiatives at Manulife, architecting <strong>agentic systems</strong>, fine-tuning <strong>large language models</strong> and building production-ready <strong>generative AI</strong> solutions.

Beyond models, I care about how things look and feel, integrating <strong>design and frontend</strong> into my work.

My journey includes roles at CAE and the Montreal Canadiens, grounded in a <strong>PhD in biomechanics</strong> with 20+ papers and open-source tools.

I'm also a competitive endurance athlete and tech enthusiast constantly refining my craft.
