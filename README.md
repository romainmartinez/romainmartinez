Hello, I'm Romain, a **data scientist** and **web developer** currently working as a Senior Data Scientist for Manulife, specializing in generative AI.

In my daily work, I implement, interpret, and deploy **machine learning models** and **statistical analyses** to aid decision-making. Although my training is primarily in data science, I also design **websites**, **interactive dashboards**, and **effective data visualizations** using modern technologies that scale well for large and complex use cases.

My skills as a data scientist are grounded in a solid education in biomechanics, a field involving **complex spatiotemporal data**, **advanced statistical models**, and a **strong mathematical foundation**. I recently completed my PhD in biomechanics, during which I published about 20 scientific papers and international presentations, taught university courses, and developed several open-source software projects.

Outside of work, I am a road cyclist. Years of competition in this sport have taught me to **focus on what I can control** and to **adapt, execute, and perform** in any situation.
