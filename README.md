Hello, I'm Romain, a **data scientist** and **web developer** currently working for the CAE Artificial Intelligence Strategy Team and the Montreal Canadiens.

In my day-to-day work, I implement, interpret and deploy **machine learning models** and **statistical analysis** that help the decision-making process. While my training is more geared toward data science, I also design **websites**, **interactive dashboards** and **effective data visualisations** built on modern technologies that scale well with large and complex use cases.

My abilities as a data scientist are rooted in a sturdy education in biomechanics, a scientific field featuring **complex spatiotemporal data**, **advanced statistical models** and a **strong mathematical component**. I recently completed my PhD in biomechanics, during which I published about 20 scientific papers and international presentations, taught university courses and developed several open source software.

Outside of work, I am a road cyclist. Several years of competition in this sport have taught me to **focus on what I can control** and to be able to **adapt, execute and perform** in any situation.
