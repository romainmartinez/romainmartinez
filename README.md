Hello, I'm Romain, a **data scientist** and **web developer** based in Montreal.

I recently completed my **PhD in biomechanics** focusing on the development of musculoskeletal models of the upper limb. Throughout my doctoral training, I published about 20 scientific papers and international presentations, taught university courses and developed several open source software.

I have been working with the **Montreal Canadiens** NHL hockey team since 2018. In this fast-paced and ever-changing environment, I use data science and web technologies to develop solutions that help the **decision-making process** in the scouting, performance and hockey operations departments.
In my day-to-day work, I implement, interpret and deploy **machine learning models** and **statistical analysis** that leverage complex data sets and third-party APIs.
While my training is more geared toward data science, I learned to design **interactive dashboards** and **effective data visualisations** built on modern technologies that scale well with large and complex use cases.

Outside of work, I am a bike racer. Several years of competition in this sport have taught me to **focus on what I can control** and to be able to **adapt, execute and perform** in any situation.
